# Assets Directory

This directory is reserved for asset files such as images, icons, and other media resources.

For the prototype, the following external resources are used:

- Company logo: Loaded from an external source during deployment
- Font Awesome icons: Loaded via CDN in the HTML file
- Chart.js: Loaded via CDN in the HTML file

In a production environment, all assets would be stored locally in this directory for improved performance and reliability.
